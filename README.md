# Introduction
The SerentityJS sample plugin provides a basic configuration for plugin usage in the software. To get started, either clone this repo or create a new repository using this template.

## Usage
The plugin system in SerenityJS is pretty simple to use and to develop on. Make sure you place your plugin within the `plugins` directory within your SerenityJS server. Once the server starts up, it will recognize the plugin and process it accordingly. Plugins that are written in TypeScript will be built upon usage. Visit our [documentation](https://serenityjs.net/) to get started!
