// Class-based plugins are more flexible and can be used to create more complex plugins.
// Function-based plugins are simpler and are used for creating simple plugins.

	// An addon plugin is bundled to the most simplistic form, without any type declarations.
	// Addon plugins are extracted at runtime and are destroyed after the server is shut down.
	// Addon plugins are used for creating simple commands, events, and other features that don't require a lot of complexity.

	// An api plugin is a plugin that exposes an api to allow other plugins to interact with.
	// Api plugins are extracted once, and the source file is deleted after the extraction.
	// The api plugin is then added to the server workspace, and other plugins can interact with it.
	// Api plugins are used for creating complex features that require multiple plugins to interact with each other.
	// Some examples of api plugins are the land claim plugin, the economy plugin, and the permission plugin.
